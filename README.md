# Scripts for "Stranger Things: A Grid-based Survey of Strange Modes in Post-Main Sequence Models"


This repository contains the Python scripts used to generate the models and data presented in "Stranger Things: A Grid-based Survey of Strange Modes in Post-Main Sequence Models" (Tarczay-Nehéz et al., 2026). The scripts automate the creation of MESA input directories for a grid of stellar masses and metallicities, including overshoot prescriptions and inlist configurations.


> ⚠️ **Important compatibility note**  
> These scripts have been tested and are known to work with:  
> - **MESA version 23.05.1**  
> - **GYRE version 7.0**  
>  
> Other versions may lead to unexpected behavior or incompatibilities.
