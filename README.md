# Scripts for "Stranger Things: A Grid-based Survey of Strange Modes in Post-Main Sequence Models"


This repository contains the Python scripts used to generate the models and data presented in "Stranger Things: A Grid-based Survey of Strange Modes in Post-Main Sequence Models" (Tarczay-Nehéz et al., 2026). The scripts automate the creation of MESA input directories for a grid of stellar masses and metallicities, including overshoot prescriptions and inlist configurations.
